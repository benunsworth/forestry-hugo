Is care for the environment a purely secular concern, or do the faith communities have a responsibility and something to contribute? Put another way, is faith only about spiritual (non-earthly) matters, plus a concern for our fellow humans, or should people of faith also have care for the earth as a core religious concern? My main expertise is in Christianity and I will outline a Christian approach first. I will then give a brief introduction to the approaches of four other world faiths with some examples of faith communities and environmental action.
