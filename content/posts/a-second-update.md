Neither religion nor science advocate the destruction of the only place in the universe
which allows life as we know it to exist. Science and religion need to combine forces to care for the
environment. Whether or not we have children and grandchildren, our commitment to SACRE means we
are concerned with the spiritual and moral welfare of children, for they are the world’s future: “the sons
and daughters of Life’s longing for itself.” (Khalil Gibran.) But what sort of a world are we offering them?
