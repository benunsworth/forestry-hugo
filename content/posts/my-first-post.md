world?

Is care for the environment a purely secular concern, or do the faith communities have a responsibility
and something to contribute? Put another way, is faith only about spiritual (non-earthly) matters, plus a
concern for our fellow humans, or should people of faith also have care for the earth as a core religious
concern? My main expertise is in Christianity and I will outline a Christian approach first. I will then give
a brief introduction to the approaches of four other world faiths with some examples of faith
communities and environmental action. 

*Christian* approaches to the environment are developed from the Hebrew Bible and the New
Testament: Genesis 1-2 provides a basis for a Stewardship Ethic where humans are commanded to take
care of God’s creation (2:15) and give leadership to the rest of creation (1:28). In the New Testament
both the incarnation and resurrection of Jesus demonstrate God’s love for his created world. In Romans
8:18-24, creation is seen as groaning and waiting for liberation. Many ‘Green Christians’ believe that this
indicates that the death and resurrection of Christ has salvation implications for the whole of creation. A
glimpse of this redemption is seen in the renewal of heaven and earth in Revelation 21-22. Some see
environmental action today as providing a glimpse of this future redeemed and reconciled world.
